(deftest cmp-all-msgs-handler
  "Tests that a very simple component that only has a handler for all messages regardless of type receives all
  messages sent to the component. State management of the component is not used here, instead we keep track
  of the messages in an atom that's external to the component and that the handler function has access to.
  A promise is used here which is delivered on when the message count received matches those sent. This does
  not tell us anything about the order yet, but it is still very useful when waiting for all messages to be
  delivered. In the subsequent assertion, we then check if the received messages are complete and in the
  expected order."

  "Like cmp-all-msgs-handler test, except that the handler function here acts on the component state provided
  in the map that the :all-msgs-handler function is called with.

  The number of messages sent in this test is somewhat arbitrarily, except that I wanted a) more than the 1024 pending
  puts that core.async allows and b) have confidence that a larger number of messages can be processed in
  very short time. Here, I test that more than 1K messages are processed per second. While timing can be problematic
  in tests, my laptop processes around 80K messages/s on the JVM (JDK 1.8) after some warming up and slightly slower
  in both Firefox and Chrome with around 70K msgs/s. If the rate dropped below 1K on ANY machine, that would indeed
  be a problem IMHO. These tests ought to quickly make visible any changes in the library that have an unfavorable
  complexity and thus provide some sanity check. Also, since the CI environment records these results, they can be
  compared over time.

  Running this test multiple times gets us a better understanding how performance increases on subsequent runs,
  likely because of JIT compilation and other optimizations in the runtime."
